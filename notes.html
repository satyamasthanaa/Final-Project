<p>The dataset we have considered, has information of a country’s economic exposure due to
COVID-19 and composite indicator based on World Bank’s datasets on remittances, food
import dependence, primary commodity export independence, tourism independence,
government indebtedness and foreign currency reserves.
</p>
<p>Original format of the dataset: XLSX</p>
<p>A brief explanation of every column in the dataset is as follows:</p>
<p>➢ <b>GHRP</b> – Global Humanitarian Response Plan for COVID-19 is the Inter-Agency Standing
Committee (ISAC) initiative to address the risks and impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the
most vulnerable people in countries affected by humanitarian crisis at high risk of facing
humanitarian disaster. The GHRP was first launched on 25 th March 2020 and was updated
first on 7 th May 2020.</p>
<p>➢ <b>Income classification according to WB (World Bank)</b> – When it comes to income, the
World Bank divides the world’s economies into four income groups: high, upper-middle,
lower-middle and low. The income classification is based on a measure of national income
per person on Gross National Income per capita, calculated using the ATLAS method.</p>
<p>➢<b> Net ODA received (% of GNI)</b> – Net official development assistance consists of
disbursements of loans made on concessional terms (net of repayments of principal) and
grants by official agencies such as DAC- Development Assistance Committee (DAC), by
multilateral institutions and by non-DAC countries to promote economic development and
welfare in countries and territories in the DAC.</p>
<p>➢ <b>Aid Dependence </b>– refers to the proportion of government spending that is given by foreign
donors. Heavy aid dependence can have significant effects on institutions and governance.</p>
<p>➢<b> Remittances and Volume of remittances (in USD) as proportion of total GDP</b> - A
remittance is a transfer of money, often by a foreign worker to an individual in their home
country. According to the World Bank, in 2018 overall global remittance grew 10% to
US$689 billion, including US$528 billion to developing countries. Remittances (money or
goods) that migrants send back to families and friends in origin countries, are often the most
direct and well-known link between migration and development.</p>
<p>➢ <b>Food imports (% total merchandise exports)</b> – this indicator provides a measure of
vulnerability and captures the adequacy of the foreign exchange reserves to pay for food
imports, which has implications for national food security depending on production and trade
patterns.</p>
<p>➢<b> Food import dependence</b> – all countries use imports to varying extents to satisfy the quantity
and diversity of the food demands of their populations; for poor countries where food imports
are a large share on country’s total trade, food security is conditioned by capacity to obtain
food through imports.</p>
➢ <b>Fuel, ores and metals exports (% of total merchandise exports)</b> – Ores and metals exports
(% of merchandise exports) in World was reported at 3.9631%. According to World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognized sources the ores and metals compromise the commodities in SITC section.
<p>➢<b>Tourism Dependence</b> – Tourism is an engine for jobs, exports, and investments. The tourism
sector is also the largest market-based contributor to finance protected areas.</p>
<p>➢<b>General government gross debt (Percent of GDP)</b> – General Government debt-to-GDP
ratio measures the gross debt of general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key
indicator for the sustainability of government finance.</p>
<p>➢<b>Total reserves in months of imports</b> – comprises holdings of monetary gold, special
drawing rights, reserves of International Monetary fund members held by the IMF, a holding
of foreign exchange under the control of monetary authorities.</p>
<p>➢<b>Government indebtedness</b> – also known as public interest, public debt, national debt and
sovereign debt, contrasts to the annual government budget deficit, which is a flow of variable
that equals the difference between government receipts and spending in a single year.</p>
<p>➢<b>Foreign currency reserves </b>– are the foreign currencies held by a country’s central bank.
They are also called foreign currency reserves or foreign reserves.</p>
<p>➢<b>Foreign direct investment net flows (% GDP)</b> – are the net inflows of investment to acquire
a lasting management interest (10 percent or more of voting stock) in an enterprise operating
in an economy other than that of the investor.</p>
<p>➢<b>Foreign direct investment (FDI)</b> – is an investment in the form of a controlling ownership
in a business in one country by an entity based in another country. It is thus distinguished
from a foreign portfolio investment by a notion of direct control.</p>
<p>➢<b>Covid-19 Economic Exposure index </b>– the target variable and the country’s economic
exposure due to COVID 19.</p>
<p>➢<b>Covid-19 Economic Exposure index [ex aid and FDI]</b> – EEI taking into consideration the
effect of the aid and FDI.</p>
<p>➢<b>Covid-19 Economic Exposure index [ex aid, FDI and Food imports] </b>– EEI taking into
consideration of all the three – aid, FDI and imports.</p>
